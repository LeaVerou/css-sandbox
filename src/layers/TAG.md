HIQaH! QaH! TAG!

I'm requesting a TAG review of Cascade Layers.

While Cascade Origins help to balance styling concerns across stakeholders --
layering browser defaults, user preferences, and document styles --
it can be useful to have similar _layering of concerns_ within a single origin.
Author styles often start with browser normalization or resets,
then layer in default typography,
broad patterns (sometimes from design systems or frameworks),
and more specific component styles.
Currently that layering has to be achieved with careful management of selector-specificity,
or over-use of `!important` flags -- both resulting in unwanted side-effects.
Cascade Layers would allow authors to define their own layering scheme
and avoid specificity or source-order conflicts across layers.

[please tell us anything you think is relevant to this review]

We'd prefer the TAG provide feedback as (please delete all but the desired option):

  üêõ open issues in our GitHub repo for **each point of feedback**

  ‚òÇÔ∏è open a single issue in our GitHub repo **for the entire review**

  üí¨ leave review feedback as a **comment in this issue** and @-notify [github usernames]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAREFULLY READ AND DELETE CONTENT BELOW THIS LINE BEFORE SUBMITTING

Please preview the issue and check that the links work before submitting.

In particular, if anything links to a URL which requires authentication (e.g. Google document), please make sure anyone with the link can access the document. We would prefer fully public documents though, since we work in the open.

¬π We require an explainer to give the relevant context for the spec review, even if the spec has some background information. For background, see our [explanation of how to write a good explainer](https://w3ctag.github.io/explainers). We recommend the explainer to be in [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

¬≤ A Security and Privacy questionnaire helps us understand potential security and privacy issues and mitigations for your design, and can save us asking redundant questions. See https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/.
