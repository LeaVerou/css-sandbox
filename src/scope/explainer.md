## Introduction

There are many overlapping
and sometimes contradictory features
that can fall under the concept of "scope" in CSS,
leading to a wide range of proposals over the years --
including a [scope specification][initial-spec] that was un-implemented
and eventually scaled back to focus on Shadow-DOM.
