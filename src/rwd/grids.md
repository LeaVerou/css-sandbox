Auto-fit and auto-fill grids
can be very helpful for
adjusting grid layouts to fit available space --
but they come with several limitations.

Are there ways we can improve the tools we have,
to help address the goal of "container queries"
inside the layout tools themselves?

## Current Issues

- Fit/fill require all columns to be identical
- There is no way to span "all" implicit & explicit tracks
- There is no way to clamp a span based on how many auto-tracks are generated
