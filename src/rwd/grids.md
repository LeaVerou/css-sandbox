Auto-fit and auto-fill grids
can be very helpful for
adjuting layouts to fit available space --
but they come with several limitations.

Are there ways we can improve the tools we have,
to help address the goal of "container queries"
inside the layout tools themselves?

## Current Issues

- Fit/fill require all columns to be identical
- There is no span-available, or minmax-span
- ??
