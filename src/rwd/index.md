Currently `@media` queries give us a way to adjust a design
based on device features, user-preferences, and viewport size.
But modern web development relies heavily on modular
"blocks" and "components"
that can be moved around.

Authors want a way to style these components
based on more immediate context --
like the width of a parent container --
which might not match cleanly to viewport media.

## In Progress

- [`@switch()` Function](switch/)
- [`@container` Rule](query/)
