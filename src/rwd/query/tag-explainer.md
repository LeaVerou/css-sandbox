## Introduction

Media-queries allow an author to make style changes
based on the overall viewport dimensions --
making responsive design possible in CSS.
But in many cases,
authors are styling modular components
that might appear in a wide variety of contexts within a page,
and there is currently no way to query the available dimensions
based on that context.
This proposal would allow an author to query
the dimensions of a container element
for conditional styling of descendants.

This solution works by applying size & layout containment
to the queried elements.
In order to make that less restrictive for authors,
we are proposing an option for single-axis size containment.
Any element with both size & layout contained
can be queried using a new `@continer` rule,
with similar syntax to existing media-queries.

## Goals

Discussion of Container/Element Queries
go back at least a decade,
and have remained one of the more heavily
requested and discussed CSS features
over that period.

There are two common cases
where media queries become particularly problematic:

- Authors want to describe components
  that can exist in different contexts --
  like a sidebar, or the main content area --
  and respond to the size of each context
  without needing to explicitly plan
  for eery possible combination
  of containers and viewport sizes
- When using flexbox and grid layouts,
  available grid-track size can change in ways
  that are difficult to describe based on viewport sizes --
  such as shrinking & growing in regular intervals
  as new columns are added or removed from the grid.

And several common example use-cases
that rely on context-relative styling:

- "Card" layouts often shift their orientation
  based on available space --
  with an image at the top in narrow context,
  moving to the side when there is available space.
- Calendar layouts often shift from list to grid view
  based on available space --
  with nested "events" that need to respond
  to the available space within a single day.
- When setting type,
  authors want to control font-size, line-length, and line-height
  in consistent relationships --
  based on the available space.

See [Phil Walton's Responsive Components][demo],
and [Typetura](https://typetura.com/)
for examples.

## Non-goals

This is not an exclusive solution
to all "responsive component" issues.
There are several other interesting discussions
that would complement this approach --
and solve different but overlapping use-cases:

- Brian Kardell's [`switch()` proposal][switch]
  would provide a value-level condition statement
  based on parent element context,
  without requiring any containment from authors.
  There are some simpler use-cases
  (like changing a single grid-template),
  where that might be a more compact and flexible option for authors.
- At-rule query blocks require an author to define
  external "breakpoints" for change,
  while flexbox & grid provide more intrinsic
  tools that adapt a layout based on both context & content.
  There might be ways to expand on those existing specifications
  to help make components even more intrinsically responsive.
- With both media- and container-queries,
  authors often want the ability to interpolate a value
  from one breakpoint to the next.
  That is especially useful for describing
  changes in typography --
  with fluid text-sizing, line-heights, and line-lengths
  based on available viewport or container dimensions.

<!-- ## [API 1]

[For each related element of the proposed solution - be it an additional JS method, a new object, a new element, a new concept etc., create a section which briefly describes it.]

```js
// Provide example code - not IDL - demonstrating the design of the feature.

// If this API can be used on its own to address a user need,
// link it back to one of the scenarios in the goals section.

// If you need to show how to get the feature set up
// (initialized, or using permissions, etc.), include that too.
```

[Where necessary, provide links to longer explanations of the relevant pre-existing concepts and API.
If there is no suitable external documentation, you might like to provide supplementary information as an appendix in this document, and provide an internal link where appropriate.]

[If this is already specced, link to the relevant section of the spec.]

[If spec work is in progress, link to the PR or draft of the spec.]

## [API 2]

[etc.]

## Key scenarios

[If there are a suite of interacting APIs, show how they work together to solve the key scenarios described.]

### Scenario 1

[Description of the end-user scenario]

```js
// Sample code demonstrating how to use these APIs to address that scenario.
```

### Scenario 2

[etc.]

## Detailed design discussion

### [Tricky design choice #1]

[Talk through the tradeoffs in coming to the specific design point you want to make.]

```js
// Illustrated with example code.
```

[This may be an open question,
in which case you should link to any active discussion threads.]

### [Tricky design choice 2]

[etc.]

## Considered alternatives

[This should include as many alternatives as you can,
from high level architectural decisions down to alternative naming choices.]

### [Alternative 1]

[Describe an alternative which was considered,
and why you decided against it.]

### [Alternative 2]

[etc.]

## Stakeholder Feedback / Opposition

[Implementors and other stakeholders may already have publicly stated positions on this work. If you can, list them here with links to evidence as appropriate.]

- [Implementor A] : Positive
- [Stakeholder B] : No signals
- [Implementor C] : Negative

[If appropriate, explain the reasons given by other implementors for their concerns.]

## References & acknowledgements

[Your design will change and be informed by many people; acknowledge them in an ongoing way! It helps build community and, as we only get by through the contributions of many, is only fair.]

[Unless you have a specific reason not to, these should be in alphabetical order.]
