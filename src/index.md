This is a scratch site for
[Miriam Suzanne](https://oddbird.net/authors/miriam/)
to take notes & document ideas
related to the
[CSS Working Group](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/)
and CSS Specifications.

I like to work in the open,
and make my notes available --
you are welcome to explore,
and even [open issues or pull-requests][gh] --
but **this is my own personal notebook,
and not a replacement for CSSWG issue threads**.

[gh]: https://github.com/oddbird/css-sandbox

## What I'm Working Onâ€¦

1. [Container Queries](/rwd/)
2. CSS Scoping & Encapsulation
3. CSS Layers
