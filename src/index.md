title: Miriam's CSS Sandbox
eleventyNavigation:
  key: home

This is a scratch site for
[Miriam Suzanne](https://oddbird.net/authors/miriam/)
to take notes & document ideas
related to the
[CSS Working Group](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/)
and CSS Specifications.

The real conversation happens in [CSSWG issue threads][drafts],
but I wanted a place to gather my own thoughts.
Everything here is a **work-in-progress**,
a personal sandbox for me to play in.
